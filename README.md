# Noita Resurrection Mod

Welcome to the Noita Resurrection Mod! This mod introduces a unique feature allowing players to resurrect after death, giving you another chance to continue your adventure in the perilous world of Noita. Now, you should of course

## Features

- **Resurrection Option**: Upon death, a popup appears with the option to resurrect by clicking the "Bullshit!" button. This gives players a second chance to continue their run.
- **Game Pause and Unpause Mechanics**: The mod includes custom pause logic to freeze and unfreeze game entities, ensuring smooth transitions between death and revival.

## Installation

1. **Download the Mod**: Clone or download the repository from GitHub.

   ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/noita-resurrection-mod.git```

2. **Locate Noita Mods Folder**: Find the Noita mods directory on your computer. This is typically located in the game's installation directory under `mods`.

3. **Move Mod Files**: Copy the downloaded mod folder into the Noita mods directory.

4. **Activate the Mod**: Launch Noita, navigate to the "Mods" menu, and activate the "Noita Resurrection Mod."

## Usage

- **Upon Death**: When your character dies, a popup will appear displaying your stats and the cause of death.
- **Resurrection**: Click the "Noita'd!" button to respawn and continue your run.
- **Confirm**: Click to confirm that you were, indeed, Noita'd. If it was a skill issue, you should accept the sacrifice you've made in the pursuit of knowledge.
- **Game Over**: Click the "End Run" button if you wish to conclude the game session.

## Future Plans

- **External Pause Library**: While everyone can always feel free to grab the code, we plan to externalize the pause functionality as a supported library soon. If anyone in the community wants to take this on and make it a standard Lua pause library that doesn't require "allow unsafe mods," feel free. Let us know if you do, as we'd love to contribute if we have time.
